# LSTM

Long Short Term Memory is a kind of recurrent neural network. In RNN output from the last step is fed as input in the current step. LSTM was designed by Hochreiter & Schmidhuber. It tackled the problem of long-term dependencies of RNN in which the RNN cannot predict the word stored in the long-term memory but can give more accurate predictions from the recent information. As the gap length increases RNN does not give an efficient performance. LSTM can by default retain the information for a long period of time. It is used for processing, predicting, and classifying on the basis of time-series data.
